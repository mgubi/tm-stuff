# A UI study for Tau

This is about learning enough Javascript/HTML to implement a UI for Tau. 

I'm using [Torus](https://github.com/thesephist/torus) as UI framework as it is small enough for me to master rapidly, yet it seems quite suitable to the needs of this project and has no dependencies. 

As a first step I need to implement most of the basic widgets TeXmacs' interface is build upon: horizontal and vertical menus, pulldown and pullright buttons, menu buttons, balloon widgets, text input widgets, enum widgets, choice widgets.
